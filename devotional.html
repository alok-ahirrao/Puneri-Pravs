              <p>Shrimant Dagadusheth Halwai and his wife Laxmibai was a Lingayat trader and sweet maker from Karnataka and settled in Pune. After he gained fame as a halwai, that became his surname. His original halwai shop still exists under the name "Dagdusheth Halwai Sweets" near Datta Mandir in Pune. Eventually he became a successful sweet seller and a rich businessman. This idol, known as Navasacha Ganpati, is the one that is present today in the Dagdusheth temple. Lokmanya Tilak and Bhausaheb Rangari, the Indian Nationalist leader and a contemporary of Dagdusheth, were close friends of Govindsheth. Tilak saw Govindsheth's dedication and also the construction of the temple, and it was here that the idea of celebrating public Ganesh festival struck him. It proved to be an epoch-making event in Indian history</p>

              <p>Southeast of Pune, 45km outside the city, resides Balaji Temple at Ketkawale, near Narayanpur. It is also known as Prati Balaji Temple, where Prati comes from Tirupati, a small district in the state of Andhra Pradesh that is home to the main Balaji Temple in India – Tirupati Balaji.
Balaji Temple, one of the topmost visited temple in Pune, is dedicated to Lord Venkateshwara and attracts many devotees every year. Set up quietly in the lap of nature, surrounded by lush greenery, it is a magnificent work of art that took seven years (1996-2003) to complete.

              <p>Saint Dnyaneshwar spent some time of his life here. This Alandi village is called as "Devachi Alandi", because there are other villages named Chorachi Alandi and Mhatobachi Alandi in Haveli taluka of Pune district. This Alandi of God is twenty five kilometers from Pune. This Alandi is of great importance for the people of Warakari as well as for all Marathi people. Dnyaneshwar took Samadhi alive here in 1296 at the age of 21. It is said that a beautiful mausoleum was built on the site in 1570 (or 1540?).

                Dnyaneshwar's palanquin leaves Alandi for Pandharpur on Ekadashi in the month of Ashadh . With this palanquin, millions of Warakaris walk a distance of about 216 km to Pandharpur to pay homage to Vithoba .

              <p>Omkareshwar temple has a huge following amongst the city people, given its rich Maratha history, and is one of the largest temples in Pune. Situated on the banks of river Mutha, at Shaniwar Peth, it was built in the 17th century by a renowned Maratha commander Chimaji Appa.
The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, as the name suggests. It also held the samadhi of Chimaji Appa since his death in 1741. With a history of the Indian freedom movement when revolutionaries like Veer Savarkar and Lokmanya Tilak held meetings inside the temple to plan against the British moves, the temple also has a strong faith due to its survival from horrific floods in 1962, which tells about its strong foundation. Devotees across the country come every year to bow their heads in reverence and seek blessings.
The temple’s architecture remains a masterpiece with sprawling verandahs, huge domes, and artistic carvings. The center of attraction is a ‘Jyotirling’ in the form of ‘Shivling’ and a giant Nandi idol, the companion of Lord Shiva.

              <p>One of the revered temples of Pune, the Chaturshringi Mandir should be on your list of places to visit when you’re in Pune. Located on Senapati Bapat Road near Pune University in Gokhale Nagar, this temple has been the place for the devotees of Mahakali and Shri Chaturshringi for ages. The word “Chaturshringi” is derived from the word “Chattu” which means “Mountain with four peaks” and represents faith and power. The main temple also includes idols of Goddess Durga, Ashtavinayaka and Ganesha.
The temple is placed on a slope, 90 ft high and around 125 ft wide. It is looked after the Chaturshringi Mandir Trust and has been well-maintained for ages. In 2013, a proposal for a ropeway to the Mandir was made in order to enable a smoother 100-step journey till the Mandir for the elderly and the physically challenged. This proposal was rejected by the Charity commissioner’s officer a few times. It is now that the Mandir Trust has finally decided to make escalators till the Temple. Chaturshringi Mandir is not only one of the largest and well-know Mandir’s in India, but it is also one of the most sacred places visited by hundreds of devotees.
